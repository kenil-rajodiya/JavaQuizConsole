# Java Console Quiz Application

A fully modular Java console application demonstrating core object-oriented programming principles. This project includes timer-based quizzes, negative marking, user management, and file handling â€” all built from scratch without external APIs.

## Features

- User registration and login with file-based persistence
- Two quiz modes:
  - Java Basics (with timer)
  - Advanced Java (with negative marking)
- Manual question entry (hardcoded for full control)
- Multithreaded timer support for timed quizzes
- Score tracking with optional penalties
- Object-oriented design using custom classes
- File handling for storing user and quiz data
